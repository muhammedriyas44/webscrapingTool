Web scraping tools used to extract data from websites. They enable users to automate the process of gathering information from multiple web pages quickly and efficiently. Web scraping is a powerful technique employed by developers, data analysts, researchers, and businesses to collect valuable data from the internet for various purposes, such as data analysis, market research, lead generation, and competitive intelligence.

Data Export: 
Once the web scraping tool extracts the information from websites, it often provides options for data export in various formats. One common format is Excel, which is widely used for data storage and analysis. With data exported to Excel, users can further manipulate, analyze, and visualize the data using spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel .

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: 
Web scraping tools may not always provide perfectly formatted data. After extracting data, it might require some cleaning and preprocessing to remove duplicates, handle missing values, and format the data correctly. This step ensures that the data is ready for analysis or other downstream processes.

Bulk Data Collection: 
Web scraping tools excel in collecting large amounts of data from multiple web pages quickly. They can scrape data from hundreds or even thousands of web pages in a relatively short period, making it valuable for tasks that require extensive data collection.
